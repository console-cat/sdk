# Console Cat SDK

Console Cat is a drop-in (cat-themed) telemetry solution for CLIs. 

We make it easy to track usage so that you can build a better CLI! 

You can sign up on [our website](https://www.consolecat.dev/).

## How-to

* [Node.js](nodejs/README.md)
* Python (coming soon!)

## Privacy

Console Cat follows the [Console Do Not Track (DNT)](https://consoledonottrack.com/) standard. Users can easily opt-out by setting the `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable to `1`.

All information we collect is anonymous and for the purposes of informing product development and debugging. We do not use it to target ads and never will.
